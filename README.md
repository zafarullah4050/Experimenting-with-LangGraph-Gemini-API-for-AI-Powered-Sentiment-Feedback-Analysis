# Experimenting-with-LangGraph-Gemini-API-for-AI-Powered-Sentiment-Feedback-Analysis
Recently, I built a small project that analyzes customer reviews using LangGraph with Googleâ€™s Gemini API.
The system works like this:

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Detects the sentiment of the review (positive/negative)
ðŸ”¹ Step 2: If negative â†’ automatically diagnoses issue type (Bug, UX, Performance, etc.), tone (angry, frustrated, calm), and urgency level
ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Generates an empathetic and helpful AI-crafted response
ðŸ”¹ Step 4: If positive â†’ sends a warm thank-you and encourages more feedback

This kind of automation can help businesses:
âœ… Understand customer pain points faster
âœ… Improve support response quality
âœ… Reduce manual workload for support teams

What excites me most is how LangGraphâ€™s workflow design makes it easy to run nodes sequentially or in parallel, depending on the logic (e.g., positive vs negative path). It feels like building a smart decision tree powered by LLMs.

ðŸ’¡ Next, I plan to connect this with live product reviews (e.g., Google Play / App Store) and make the pipeline fully automated.

ðŸ‘‰ Question for my network:
How do you see AI-driven feedback analysis changing the way companies handle customer experience?
